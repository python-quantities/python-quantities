0.8.0
-----

Quantities now requires Python-2.6 or later. Python-3 is supported. 

The fill method, and __setitem__ methods will now accept scalar
values in addition to quantities. If a scalar is passed, an
assumption is made that the change should only be applied to the
quantity's magnitude. The fill method will also accept a quantity
with incompatible units, and will overwrite the previous units.

The log and exp functions have been removed. Quantities will work
with numpy's version of these functions.

Quantities development has migrated from bzr/launchpad to
git/github. Please report problems to 
http://github.com/python-quantities/python-quantities or visit the
mailing list at http://groups.google.com/group/python-quantities

0.7.0
-----

A critical problem was identified, caused by a conflict between farad
and Faraday identified in quantities <0.7. F is commonly used as a
symbol for both the farad and Faraday's constant. This is problematic
for quanitities, which registers its units so they can be accessed
using a string corresponding to the unit name or symbol. In this
case, the Faraday constant was registered after the farad, so any
quantity that was expressed in terms of farads would be incorrectly
simplified using the Faraday constant. This problem has been fixed
and the registry has been improved to prevent overwriting previously
registered names or symbols. F is now reserved for the farad.

Addition and subtraction of quantities with different but compatible
units is now supported. Additionally, changes have been made in the
forthcoming numpy-1.4.0 to extend this compatibility to other ufuncs
as well.

Numpydoc, an external package developed to extend Sphinx for the
numpy documentation project, is now required to build quantities'
documentation.
